# billingaws
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to interact with Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). It allows users to perform the following tasks:

Retrieve AWS billing details using Cost Explorer.
Upload a file to an S3 bucket.
Invalidate the CloudFront distribution cache.
Prerequisites
Before using the script, make sure you have the following:

AWS Account: You should have an active AWS account with appropriate access rights to perform the tasks mentioned in the script.

AWS Credentials: Obtain your AWS access key and secret key, which will be used to authenticate API requests. Ensure these keys have the necessary permissions to interact with S3, CloudFront, and Cost Explorer services.

Boto3 Library: Install the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. You can install it using the following command:

Copy code
pip install boto3
Configuration
Before running the script, make sure to provide the necessary configuration in the script:

Replace 'your-access-key' and 'your-secret-key' with your AWS access key and secret key, respectively.

Replace 'your-s3-bucket-name' with the name of the S3 bucket to which you want to upload the file.

Replace 'path/to/your/file.txt' with the path to the file you want to upload to S3.

Replace 'your-cloudfront-distribution-id' with the CloudFront distribution ID for which you want to invalidate the cache.

Running the Script
Once you have configured the script with the required credentials and information:

Save the script to a Python file (e.g., aws_script.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python aws_script.py
Function Details
The script is organized into three main functions:

initialize_clients(access_key, secret_key): This function initializes AWS SDK clients for S3 and CloudFront using the provided access key and secret key.

get_billing_details(): This function retrieves billing details from AWS Cost Explorer for a specified time period. The time period is set to '2023-07-01' to '2023-07-25', and the script fetches daily blended cost metrics.

upload_to_s3_and_cloudfront(bucket_name, file_path, distribution_id): This function uploads a file to the specified S3 bucket and invalidates the CloudFront cache for the given distribution ID. The function utilizes the initialize_clients function to initialize S3 and CloudFront clients.

Important Note
Ensure that the AWS credentials you use to run the script have the necessary permissions to perform the required actions. Be cautious with sharing or exposing your AWS access key and secret key.

The script provided here is a basic example, and it's essential to implement proper error handling and security measures before deploying it in a production environment.
