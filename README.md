# AWS Communication Check using Boto3
This Python script demonstrates how to check AWS communication using Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. It uses a simple API call to list the buckets in an AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) region to verify if the communication with AWS is successful.

# Integrating python with AWS S3

This repository provides a guide on how to configure AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, check the connection between AWS and Python, and create S3 instances using Python.

+ Ensure you have boto3 installed. You can install it using the following command: pip install boto3
+ Use the boto3 library to check your AWS connection by running the provided Python script: aws_configuration.py
# Creating S3 Bucket using Python
+ Run the provided Python script:create S3.py to create an S3 Bucket with your desired parameters.
